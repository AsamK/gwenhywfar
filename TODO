db:
  - improve file reading/writing
dbio:
  - use generic plugin framework for plugin loading
crypt:
  - remove old list functions, replace them by the list macros
    (will break compatibility -> for next major version)
msgengine:
  - use "storedAs" in VALUE tags also

xml:
  - read encodings from XML header and convert text accordingly
  - add argument to file reader/writer code which contains the target
    encoding
  - create an XML loader/saver context. This may contain callbacks for
    postprocessing of tags when reading an XML file. It may also contain
    some conversion settings etc.
