===========================================================================

The changes in this release are as follows:
Some problems in GWEN_CryptToken when keys smaller than 96 bytes are used
were fixed (this allows AqBanking/AqHBCI to work with some banks again!).
This version also fixes some bugs thus making network-timeout problems less
likely to occurr.
A request wrapper around existing IPC code was added.


===========================================================================
