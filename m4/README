This folder includes some usefull macros for the automake/autoconf tools.
This dramatically simplifies the "configure.in" file.

All "*.m4" files are copied into "../acinclude.m4"
All "*.h" files are copied into "../acconfig.h".

So if your're adding a macro file here that defines some values to be
presented in "config.h" you must provide a header file, too. Otherwise
aclocal or whatever autotool that was complains about a symbol not being
covered by aclocal.h.
