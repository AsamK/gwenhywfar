This is Gwenhywfar, a multi-platform helper library for networking and
security applications and libraries. It is heavily used by libchipcard
http://www.libchipcard.de, OpenHBCI2 http://www.openhbci.de, and the
simulation tool Simthetic http://simthetic.sourceforge.net .


Features
--------

This library is written in C, and it follows the object-oriented
programming paradigm for most of its parts.  The header files can
directly be used from C++, too.

Gwenhywfar includes the following features:

- Basic Data types for binary buffers, ring buffers, linked lists, 
  error objects, string lists (src/base/), buffered IO operations (src/io/)

- Macros for typesafe list management

- OS abstraction functions for directory and Internet address handling
  and library loading (src/os/)

- Networking functions which allow to manage many connections to be used
  economically even in single threaded applications

- High-level functions for parsing files with a simplified "XML-like"
  format and accessing them like a hierarchical database (src/parser/)

- High-level cryptographic functions on top of OpenSSL functionality
  (src/crypt/)



Requirements
------------

- OpenSSL >= 0.9.6x (0.9.7x recommended); this can optionally be
  disabled by the configure switch --disable-ssl


Platforms
---------

Gwenhywfar is being developed on Linux. But the following platforms are also
supported:

- Windows (98, NT and newer; for using this library from Microsoft
  Visual Studio C please see the explanations in test/README.MSVC)

- FreeBSD (untested, but most likely to work)
- NetBSD  (untested, but most likely to work)
- OpenBSD (untested, but most likely to work)
- Mac OS-X (untested)



Documentation
-------------

Currently the documentation can only be found in the header
files. Many header files already include extensive comments in
doxygen-format (however some don't).
For a more or less complete API documentation use the command
"make srcdoc"
You will need the tool doxygen for this command to run.

Name
----

The name of this library was chosen to honour a very special person ;-)
(that should suffice as an explanation)
